## About our Manifesto

At NovoScale we are a team that strongly believes in the power of simplification. Everything we do is with the purpose of making our customers and end-user's cloud journey seamless, effective, and easy. We acknowledge that the cloud is currently a fast growing sector within the IT industry that is forever changing the way how businesses operates. Most people find the cloud to be complex, and they ask questions like: "how do I provide timely support to my users?", "how do I operate cloud software effectively and efficiently?" “who should I hire?” "what methodology and tools should I use?" and it goes on and on and on.
 
At NovoScale we join our customers on their cloud journey, by making it radically simple. We combine certified engineers with automation and make it easy for them to manage and enhance their cloud software. Our ultimate goal is to power the future of business software by creating experiences our customers love.
 
Our promise is to relentlessly focus on our customers and stay true to our core values. We won't change the way we operate if the company goes public, as these are the values that shaped our mission and our day/to/day work from Day 1.
 
### Relentless customer focus
Everything we do has the ultimate goal of delighting our customers by providing a top of line cloud service. All the way from sales, to finance, HR and our office layout is thought with our customers at the centre. We will always ask ourselves the question: "is this something that will have a better impact on our customer experience?" Our decisions will be driven having that as a north and we will never compromise the quality in what we do. We will combine our fanatic discipline with empirical creative to achieve the best outcomes.
We are not an outsourcing company offering a standard service, we are a team that always pushes ourselves to be better, more competitive and go above and beyond our client’s expectations. We will develop strong relationships with our partners to achieve that.
 
### Think at Scale
Time is precious. Everything we embark on will aim to simplify and automatize the way we operate, avoiding inefficiencies, redundancies and time waste at all cost. From staff meetings, to sales strategy and office expansion will always aim to answer if what we are doing is scalable: can this be done for 100, 1000, 1000000 people? How can we simplify the steps to make this scalable and inclusive? Scale brings consistency and growth and we will require that everyone in our teams has scalability as a mindset.

### Inspire performance
The greatest achievements were made by people with drive, tenacity and risk taking spirit. Each of us has the responsibility of driving our lives, in and outside work. We will help our people managers and leaders in supporting their teams' growth and development and will provide the environment where drive is always allowed and high performance is always encourage. Will invest time, effort and money in making sure we hire and develop the best people managers able to
Build high performing teams, adapt in the face of uncertainty and cast a shadow of behaviors for others to follow. We will also provide the working environment that promotes the best performance and we’ll reinforce accountability, Each of us will have the responsibility of pushing through our goals, delivering on our commitments whilst developing our careers.
 
### Be bold
We are not a company that will play by the book. We will always ask ourselves how we can be better, how can we offer a top of line unique experience. We will be curios, empirical creators and even paranoids, always ready to face the changes our world will promote. Providing a work environment where failure is leveraged as a path of learning and where teams are able to speak up and bring new ideas is key to us. We believe that the best ideas come from unknown places, so we'll focus on providing the environment and tools for invention to take place. That will become our value add.
 
### Be noble
We take very seriously creating an environment of respect, collaboration and partnership. In every meeting, email or chat we send everyone should assume positive intent and aim to help address what's going on. Delivery and professionalism will be key and we won't compromise the quality nor accept excuses without a proposed solution plan.
We believe in the power of celebration and on creating the space for people to share openly, speak up and reach out. We will expect from our NovoScalers that they’ll be always ready to lend a hand. We don't believe in hierarchies where top executives are far away and mysterious, we consider ourselves as team.
